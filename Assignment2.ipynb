It plays a vital role in enhancing the performance of a software or a program as the main function of the software is to store and retrieve the user's data as fast as possible.Data Structures are necessary for designing efficient algorithms. It provides reusability and abstraction . Using appropriate data structure, can help programmers save a good amount of time while performing operations such as storage, retrieval or processing of data.\")"
