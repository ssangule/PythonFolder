If we create an identifier that starts with a digit then we will get a syntax error...We also cannot use special symbols in the identifiers name...A keyword cannot be used as an identifier. In Python, keywords are the reserved names that are built-in in Python. They have a special meaning and we cannot use them as identifier names...The length of the identifiers can be as long as you want. Of course, it can not be greater than the available memory, however, the PEP-8 standards rule suggests not to exceed 79 characters in a line.\")"
