When you use duck typing, you do not check types at all. Instead, you check for the presence of a given method or attribute...Dunder or magic methods in Python are the methods having two prefix and suffix underscores in the method name. Dunder here means “Double Under (Underscores)”. These are commonly used for operator overloading... These methods are the reason we can add two strings with '+' operator without any explicit typecasting.\")"
